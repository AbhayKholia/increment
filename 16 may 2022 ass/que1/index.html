    <b> b tags</b> 
    <p>The <b> tag in HTML is used to specify the bold text without any extra importance. The text is written within <b> tag display in bold size. You can do that by using font-weight: bold; property in CSS. It is a container tag that contains an opening tag, content & closing tag</p>


    <i>i tags</i>
    <p>The <i> tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
    The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.
     Use the <i> element only when there is not a more appropriate semantic element</p>


    <u> u tags</u>
    <p>The <u> tag represents some text that is unarticulated and styled differently from normal text, such as misspelled words or proper names in Chinese text. The content inside is typically displayed with an underline. You can change this with CSS (see example below). </p>

    
   <select>select tags</select>
   <p>The <select> element is used to create a drop-down list.
    The <select> element is most often used in a form, to collect user input.
    The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the drop-down list will be submitted).
    The id attribute is needed to associate the drop-down list with a label.
    The <option> tags inside the <select> element define the available options in the drop-down list
    </p>

<button>button tags</button>
<p>The <button> tag defines a clickable button.

    Inside a <button> element you can put text (and tags like <i>, <b>, <strong>, <br>, <img>, etc.). That is not possible with a button created with the <input> element!</p>
